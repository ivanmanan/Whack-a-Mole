Whack-A-Mole with LEDs

Built an electronic game that imitates Whack-A-Mole. LED lights blink arbitrarily with a beeping noise and the user
presses the button corresponding to the illuminated LED. The entire device is soldered onto a single stripboard.

Integrated Arduino to formulate the probability of which LED blinks and to program an accompanying buzz noise
to notify the user when the game begins and ends. The Arduino was connected to pushbuttons, LEDs, and a speaker.
